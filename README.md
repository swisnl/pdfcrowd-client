This is a API client for pdfcrowd.com. It is based on the [pdfcrowd/pdfcrowd-php](https://github.com/pdfcrowd/pdfcrowd-php) project but adjusted for usage with Composer. It also includes a Laravel service provider and unit tests.

## Work in progress

This client is still under active development. What needs to be done:
- Improve docs: in what way does this package differ from the original class?
- Improve docs: add docblocks to all setters.
- Improve docs: try to generate docs for complete class?
- Tag a version and release!

## Install

> In order to make requests to the API you need to enable the PHP cURL library.

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require swisnl/pdfcrowd-client
```

## Laravel

We provide a service provider so you can use dependency injection of the Pdfcrowd class within your Laravel projects. If you don't use [package auto-discovery](https://laravel-news.com/package-auto-discovery), add the ServiceProvider to the providers array in config/app.php

```php 
Swis\PdfcrowdClient\PdfcrowdServiceProvider::class,
```

Then, publish the config file using:

```php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Swis\PdfcrowdClient\PdfcrowdServiceProvider"
```

## Usage

``` php
# instantiate client, Laravel users can use dependency injection
$client = new Pdfcrowd('username', 'api_key');
 
# convert HTML to PDF and output
echo $client->convertHtml($someHtml);
 
# convert URI to PDF and output
echo $client->convertUri('https://google.com');
 
# convert to PDF and write to file
$client->setOutputDestination(fopen('path/to/output.pdf', 'w');
$client->convertHtml($someHtml);
 
# retrieve the amount of available tokens
$tokens = $client->availableTokens();
 
# retrieve the amount of tokens used by the previous conversion
$tokens = $client->getUsedTokens(); 
```
